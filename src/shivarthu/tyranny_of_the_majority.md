# Tyranny of the Majority

Tyranny of the majority is a concept that highlights a potential flaw in democratic systems, where the majority, in pursuit of its own interests, oppresses or neglects the rights and interests of minority groups. John Stuart Mill, in his 1859 book "On Liberty," argued that this kind of tyranny could be as oppressive as the rule of a despot. To overcome tyranny of the majority, various strategies and mechanisms can be employed, as illustrated in the provided examples:


1. **Centralization Excess:**
   - **Scenario:** In a federal system, the centralized power of a federation makes decisions that should be handled at the local level. This goes against the principle of subsidiarity, which advocates that decisions should be made at the most local level possible.
   - **Solution:** To overcome this tyranny of the majority, several measures can be taken.
     - **Concurrent Majority:** Implement a concurrent majority mechanism where both the federal and local authorities must agree on certain matters to ensure that local interests are adequately represented.
     - **Supermajority Rules:** Require a supermajority vote for decisions that significantly affect local jurisdictions, making it harder for the majority to impose their will without considering minority interests.

**Example:** Consider a federal system where the majority at the federal level wants to impose a uniform policy on education for all states. This decision might neglect the unique needs and preferences of individual states. To overcome the tyranny of the majority, a concurrent majority mechanism could be established, requiring both the federal government and individual states to agree on significant education policy changes, ensuring that local interests are protected.

2\. **Abandonment of Rationality:**

- **Scenario:** When decisions are based solely on numerical majorities without considering their correctness or excellence. In such cases, decisions may be arbitrary and not necessarily in the best interests of the society as a whole.
- **Solution:** To avoid the tyranny of the majority based on irrational decisions, several steps can be taken:
  - **Public Consultation:** Involve the public in the decision-making process by seeking their input, which can help ensure a more rational decision-making process.
  - **Technical Consulting Bodies:** Establish expert panels or consulting bodies to provide informed and unbiased advice on complex issues.
  - **Judicial Review:** After a decision is made, it can be subjected to judicial review to ensure it complies with the rule of law and constitutional principles. Courts can declare decisions null and void if they are found to be irrational or unconstitutional.

**Example:** Imagine a scenario where a majority of voters support a policy that goes against scientific evidence, such as denying climate change. To overcome the tyranny of this majority, public consultations involving scientists and experts can be held to present the facts. Additionally, a legal system that allows judicial review can act as a safeguard, ensuring that decisions are rational and constitutional.

In both scenarios, the key is to introduce checks and balances that prevent the majority from imposing its will in a way that harms minority rights or results in irrational or arbitrary decisions. These mechanisms aim to strike a balance between majority rule and the protection of minority interests and the principles of rationality and fairness.

# Tyranny of the Minority
The tyranny of the minority occurs when a supermajority consensus is required for a decision, and a minority, in pursuit of its own interests, oppresses or neglects the rights and interests of the majority groups. 

**Example:** Creating an Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) area or controlling traffic where cars are not allowed, but a minority group of car owners opposes it. Though it is difficult to pass such a bill with a supermajority decision, the minority can create a blockage. Once the bill is passed, it becomes challenging to reverse.


## How will Shivarthu's direct democracy solve the tyranny of the majority/minority?

Suggestion:

Some of the voting or feedback sytem.

1. **Direct Voting by Local Citizens:** This method involves directly polling local citizens.
2. **Schelling Game Decision by Users:** Users make decisions using the Schelling game.
3. **Voting by Representatives Elected via Proportional Approval Voting**: Representatives are elected by the people through a proportional approval voting system ([Sequential Phragm√©n](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-phragmen))
4. **Voting by Department Representatives with Specialized and Multidisciplinary Knowledge:** Department representatives with specialized and multidisciplinary knowledge participate in the voting process.
5. **Providing More Voting Weight to Individuals Creating Positive Externalities:** This approach assigns greater voting weight to individuals who generate [positive externalities](https://github.com/amiyatulu/shivarthu/tree/main/pallets/positive-externality-validation).

   These different methods can enhance rationality and reduce centralization excess. Double approval can be implemented using these voting methods. Additionally, a discussion forum can be created where different voters can articulate the reasons for their approval or disapproval of a decision.

   Further consideration is needed to determine when to employ a simple majority or a supermajority.
